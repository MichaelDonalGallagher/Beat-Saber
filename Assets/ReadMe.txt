I didn't get to test if the Menu Buttons work in VR so if they don't you'll have to
load into the scenes individually. Easy, Medium and Hard just change the speed with
which the cubes spawn and array spawns about 10 cubes at set intervals before getting
stuck. I didn't want to add a Victory Scene because I preffered it being endless and
didn't think it would be that different than the game over scene.

Again because I couldn't test if the buttons work I left the Game over scene without 
them and instead to restart you have to reboot the game.

I couldn't get the lives variable to print to screen and so instead it prints the lives
number everytime a cube is missed in the console.

Everything else should work fine.
